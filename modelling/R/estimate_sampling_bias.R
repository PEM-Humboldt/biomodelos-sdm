#' Estimate the bias for a set of species occurrences
#'
#' @description Calculates the bias of a set of species occurrences using the Target Group Sampling (TGS) method.
#' TGS estimates sampling by using the presence locations of taxonomically related species observed
#' using the same techniques as the focal species, under the assumption that those surveys would have
#' recorded the focal species had it occurred there. This function creates a probability surface for
#' the study area, with a Kernel Density Estimator (KDE), where higher probability values are assigned
#' to areas with more locality points. Then, pseudo-absences are selected probabilistically, based on that surface.
#' 
#' @param data. data frame containing the species occurrences.
#' @param TGS.kernel character string of the path to the raster file with the kernel for TGS.
#' @param shape.M shapefile with the extent and shape of the study area.
#' @param env.M raster stack of environmental variables for the study area.
#' @param folder.sp character string folder path to save the output files.
#' @param col.lon character string of column name for the longitude in the data frame.
#' @param col.lat character string of column name for the latitude in the data frame.
#' @param col.sp character string of column name for the species names in the data frame.
#' 
#' @details TGS uses the presence locations of taxonomically related species observed using the same techniques as 
#' the focal species (usually from the same database) to estimate sampling, under the assumption that those surveys 
#' would have recorded the focal species had it occurred there

#' This code was adapted from supplementary materials of Fitzpatrick et al. 2013. Ecosphere 4(5): Article 55. This 
#' involves creating a probability surface for the study area, with a Kernel Density Estimator (KDE), where higher 
#' probability values are assigned to areas with more locality points. Then, pseudo-absences are selected 
#' probabilistically, based on that surface.

#' @return A data frame with the latitude, longitude, and probability of occurrence for each cell in the
