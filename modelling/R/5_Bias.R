## BIAS


# Adding bias TGS
# TGS uses the presence locations of taxonomically related species observed using the same
# techniques as the focal species (usually from the same database) to estimate sampling, under the
# assumption that those surveys would have recorded the focal species had it occurred there

# This code was adapted from supplementary materials of Fitzpatrick et al. 2013. Ecosphere
# 4(5): Article 55. This involves creating a probability surface for the study area, with a Kernel
# Density Estimator (KDE), where higher probability values are assigned to areas with more locality   # points. Then, pseudo-absences are selected probabilistically, based on that surface.
